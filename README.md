## Machine Learning Model Used
The model used in this analysis is sklearn Linear Regression. Regression analysis describes the relationships between a set of independent variables and the dependent variable. Regression analysis produces a regression equation where the coefficients represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. This equation can be used to make predictions.
